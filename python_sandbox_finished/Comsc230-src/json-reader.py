Description: 
    This program takes a json input file staff.json (exported from a MySql database) and 
    prints out the keys.

import json, ast


# Some test json data for debugging. 
# Note JSON uses double quotes for both keys and values, ie: "type": "1"
# wheras a javascript object does not have quotes around the keys, 
#  for example:  var testObject = {one: 1,"two":2,"three":3};

# Exercise: 
# Use json-reader.py to read json files from the 'northwind' SQL database:
# Step 1: Use XAMPP to export files in JSON format from the 'northwind' database
# Step 2: Copy the downloaded files into a 'DataFiles' folder in your project
# Step 3: get the path to the DataFiles folder into your clipboard
#  paste it into the 'folderPath' variable, (remove the filename if it is at the end of the path)
# Step 4: Initialize the 'fileName' variable with the filename.
# Step 5: Run the program using VS Code 'Run File in Terminal' (right click on filename).
